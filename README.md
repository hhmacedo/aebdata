# aebdata

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The package aebdata is part of an effort by the [Atlas do Estado
Brasileiro](https://www.ipea.gov.br/atlasestado/) to facilitate peopleâ€™s
access to Brazilian data so that anyone can conduct their analysis. The
data, available in .csv format within the series, can now be downloaded
directly from R.

## Installation

There are two methods to install the aebdata package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# The first is a more verbose and human-readable way, using pak:

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("hhmacedo/aebdata")

# The second is a lighter and more programmatic version:

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hhmacedo/aebdata")
```
